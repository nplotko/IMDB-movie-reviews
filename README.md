# IMDB Movie Reviews

In this project, I perform the following steps:
<ul>
  <li>Data Import and HTML Cleaning</li>
  <li>Used Sklearn's count vectorizer to generate word frequencies for wordcloud</li> 
  <li>Used SpaCy's part-of-speech tagging to generate noun frequencies for wordcloud of nouns</li>
  <li>Generate seaborn plots to visualize the length of response and the class balance</li>
  <li>Used Sklearn's TF-IDF vectorizer to transform the review into sparse form</li>
  <li>Used Sklearn's validation_curve to cross-validate hyperparameters for logistic regression and K nearest neighbors</li>
  <li>Trained LinearSVC to compare to best scoring models</li>
  <li>Concluded that logistic regression (with C = ~ 5) is the best performing model</li>
</ul>
